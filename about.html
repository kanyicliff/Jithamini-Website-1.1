    				<p>We sat down as a group back in 2020 and saw the need to restructure the organization. Due to covid19 restrictions, we were not able to do mentorship in schools and we saw this as the best time to do what we have always wanted to do – ugrade to an NGO.
            </p>
    				<p>Rebrading would be the first thing in-line and we agreed to change the name from EWEMWA to TAI, a swahili name for eagle. However, we discovered the name TAI was being used by another company, and hence the change to JITHAMINI.
            </p>
            <p>
              The journey to submit and meet the NGO requirements started in 2020 with a group of seven (7) men and women who selflessly dedicated their time, ideas into what is now JITHAMINI and in Feb 2022 we got our approval and on April 28/04/22 we got our certificate.

              We believe that knowledge is power and complimenting the efforts of faith and community-based organizations, we believe we have the capacity to uplift the lives of the people living in Embakasi West. We have since inception seven years ago, impacted over 200,000 primary school students in various programs like distribution of sanitary pads to the girls, provision of free uniforms to vulnerable children in all the 11 public schools in Embakasi West, mentorship of boys and girls of adolescent age, rehabilitation of classes under Adopt-a-class program, first aid training in the schools, community clean ups, and providing musical instruments to autistic children among many others.

          <p>
            When we first embarked on our journey, we thought it was only going to be donation of sanitary pads to the girls. However, we were met with different other needs within the schools, and so our vision began to grow instantly. 
          </p>
          <p>
            On the same journey, having started out as an all women group, there was need for mentoring the boy child, and we starterd with only one man, but by the grace of God, the men are now more than the women.
